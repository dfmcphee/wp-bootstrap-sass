## How to use Carousel

* Click Carousels-> Add New
* Create a WordPress gallery in the media library and add it to the post
* Publish the post and make note of the ID (Shown in a widget. If you can't see it check your screen options and make sure 'Carousel ID' is checked)
* You can then use the shortcode '[carousel id="___ID___"]' replacing ___ID___ with the post id you noted earlier.
